ROP 1 - 100
============

Desc:
This binary is running on a machine with ASLR! Can you bypass it? The binary can be found at /home/rop1/ on the shell server. The source can be found here.

Hint:
ASLR is hard to beat if you need to predict an address, but what if you don't? What does %eax contain when vuln returns? Is there any code in the program which calls or jumps to it?
